# LCBO API

This is a project to practice using AJAX requests in JavaScript. It uses the LCBO API available at [LCBO API](https://lcboapi.com)

The project uses ES6 JavaScript for the most part.
- const
- let
- String templates
- Arrow function

## Things I plan on Refactoring and changing

- [x] Create FUNCTIONS, like not a person who doesn't create functions.
- [x] Use the Fetch API rather than using XmlHttpRequest method
- [x] Switch any let declarations to const where applicable
- [x] Change any function declarations to arrow functions
- [x] Change for loops to array methods if applicable

## Things to make better or things to add
- [x] Change the behaviour of changing pages. Make it so it shows the next page of what every type of liquor the user is currently looking at.
- [ ] Change the Select box to empty when page changes?
- [x] Add Previous Button
- [ ] Make Previous Button work correctly
